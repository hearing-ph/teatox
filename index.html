Actually, 92 % of all death cases are caused by ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs! Even those cases, we consider as normal death of the person, are also cause by ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs. ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs can develop inside your brain, liver, lungs, blood, stomach and intestines. Almost all of them are very harmful for your body. Some can destroy the organ immediately, while others work slower. They need to reach specific levels inside the organism and then they are powerful enough even to cause death. We have to know we all have ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs in our bodies. Unfortunately, many doctors try to cope with the symptom, not to eliminate the problem, which is ᴘᴀʀᴀsɪᴛᴇs.
